## Tips

How low should the tide be to see something at Changi?

The lower the tide, the more of the shore is exposed! Some of the sandy shores near Changi Carpark 6 can be explored at tides of 0.4m and below for Changi tide tables (as in the photo below).

But much lower tides are needed to view the seagrass meadows near Changi Carpark 7. Only a narrow portion of the meadows are exposed at a tide of about 0.2m for Changi tide tables (as in the photo below).
Narrow intertidal shore at Changi
At tides 0.1m and below, a wider expanse of shore is exposed (as in the photo below). But usually for only a brief period of about half an hour to an hour. So you need to be punctual!

Such low spring tides tend to occur near or after sunset at this time of the year. The marinas based at Changi provide on their website, the hour-by-hour predicted tides for Changi. Links to these and more about Singapore's tides here.

## tamban fishing

You can do a quick estimate of the current speed by lookng at the debris in the water, preferrably those just below the water surface and see how fast they're drifting away from you. Of course, the surest way is to lower your rig down into the water. If your line is vertical when it reaches the bottom, then there's no current. The faster the current the further away it will drift. For tamban fishing you need not use very heavy sinkers despite strong current because you should be short casting and retrieving it and the tambans are typically in mid water to near water surface.

Tidetable also can tell you whether the current will be fast on that day. Look out for days with very high tides(ie.3.0m) or very low tides(0.5m). Those days usually concide with days near full or new moon when the current will be strong. The tide table can be relatively accurate for gauging current along inshore, but it can be a totally different story if we're talking about offshore.

I like to use size 6 for jigging bait fish on jetty. If you are jigging specifically for Tamban, you can use size 4-5.

They now come to bedok jetty at the outgoing tide ususally, incoming tides usually only have a few. the faster and stonger the current, selar may come too but when there are selar the tambans will top biting

Was jigging for taman at BJT, that's no season for it, but once or twice a month during strong current flow (That's what the old uncle told me) you can hook more taman, normally i hook around 50+ but on good day u can get 100+ in less than 2hr.
Timing will be around 7am to 10am and 4pm to 7pm.
Get the hook from those old uncle there, 3 set for $5 or 7 set for $10. Use size 0.5 sinker, cast it against the current flow.
